          <h2>Your website</h2>
          <p>
            Pages built on site builders stay on site builders (the same site
            builder). There is no easy way to transfer them out because the
            source code of your page is translated into metadata. Many similar
            services operate the same way. This means if you decide you want to
            change to a different hosting platform, you will have to reconstruct
            the pages and whatever functionality they contain.

          <h2>Less monthly costs</h2>
          <p>
            If you don’t want to provide free advertising for the service you
            built your site on, or you don’t want to have any restrictions over
            what you can do on your own site, you’ll have to pay extra for it,
            and the price will be typically higher than it would be for normal
            hosting.

          <h2>Optimisation </h2>
          <p>
            Personalised code is nearly always more efficient. The source code
            of ready- made websites is not minimalistic by any means since it
            must be very adaptable and also hosts mandatory advertisement
            information. This increases the chance of your site failing on a
            technical level.

          <h2>Security</h2>
          <p>
            Now ready-made websites aren’t by any means weak in terms of
            security. However, since they’re based on a same model everytime,
            they’re an attractive target for hackers. It’s much more worth
            hacking a model that has been using countless of times rather than a
            single website. Furthermore, security can be adapted to your needs
            and our standards and the code behind your website will only be
            accessible to you and those you wish to authorise.

          <h2>Originality</h2>
          <p>
            Both your code and your design will be original ! Have you ever
            noticed that some websites have a lot in common? And then, every
            once in a while, you’ll come across two or more sites that have way
            too much in common? That’s the problem of template-based design.
            There’s nothing wrong with templates if you’re properly customizing
            them and turning them into something completely original, but huge
            numbers of people just seem to be too lazy for that. The result of
            that lack of effort is going to be less customers for you (or your
            client) because they don’t see your site as offering anything
            unique. This gives you the custom edge, no one else is going to have
            the same layout to you or the same content.

        Building a website is an investment. While the initial cost is higher
        than using a free template, your product will be more secure, optimised,
        original and can be easily upgraded in the long-run. All of the famous
        websites that you use everyday (Facebook, Airbnb, TripAdvisor,
        Instagram, Reddit, LinkedIn and thousands more) were built that way
        because they needed a custom product with a vision. If that is what you
        want for yourself or your business, send us a quote and we’ll be happy
        to discuss your project with you.
